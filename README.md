# evaluation of rnaseq results (Waddlia chondrophila)

- fastqc
- map do reference genome
- qualimap
- read counts with htseq
- extraction of mapped reads
- downsampling of mapped reads => mapping ==> rarefaction curve of the number of CDS with a minimum of X mapped reads

## TODO

- [X] add automated download of reference genome (+ annotation)
- [ ] normalization of read counts
- [ ] differential expression analyses
- [ ]
